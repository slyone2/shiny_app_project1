## Introduction

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong 
evidence that it is harmful to human health.The My_Shiny_App shows the total emissions 
from PM2.5 for each of the five largest cites in the United States (New York City, New York; 
Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; Houston, Texas; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), 
for the calendar years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.  For each year the NEI records how many tons 
of PM2.5 were emitted from all sources over the course of the entire year.
